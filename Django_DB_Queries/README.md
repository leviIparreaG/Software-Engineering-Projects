# Django Database Queries 
## Description
In this practice, you will perform basic database queries using Django ORM on a preloaded SQLite database (`db.sqlite3`). The focus is on understanding Django models, querying techniques, and rendering query results in HTML templates using Bootstrap.

The practice covers:
- Reviewing the `models.py` to understand database structure.
- Writing queries in the `views.py` functions assigned to your team.
- Printing query results for verification.
- Rendering the query results in an HTML page with Bootstrap styling.
- Passing query results to templates as context variables.

## Technologies
- Python 3
- Django
- SQLite
- Bootstrap 5

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 and Django installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory containing `manage.py`.
