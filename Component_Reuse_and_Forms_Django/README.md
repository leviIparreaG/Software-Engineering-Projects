# Component Reuse and Forms in Django

## Description
This project demonstrates how to reuse interface components in Django applications to maintain consistency and reduce redundant code. It also covers the creation and handling of forms using Django's built-in forms framework.

Key aspects include:
- Designing reusable UI components with templates (e.g., product cards) to ensure consistent look and feel.
- Implementing grid layouts using CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Materialize.
- Creating and validating various form fields such as `CharField`, `ChoiceField`, `EmailField`, `MultipleChoiceField`, and `IntegerField`.
- Handling form submission and validation in Django views.
- Rendering forms dynamically in templates and processing user input securely.

- Python 3
- Django
- Bootstrap / Materialize CSS
